Questions:
• In your point of view, what was complicated in the TP#2? What where your pain points? What could you do when expanding this TP to avoid these further?
• What are the S.O.L.I.D. principles? What are the “KISS rule” and the “boy scout rule”? What’s clean code, clean architecture?
• How would you expand this code? What can you add to the software you build to make it more useful, reliable, relevant to the user? Find 5 ways to improve your previous TP, even if that’s not doable.

Answers:

• in general, tp2 was not that difficult. it was just a matter of retrieving the data. however, the most difficult part was the architecture of the code and being able to correctly retrieve the right data. To make it easier I would say it would be wise to better architect my code for more modurality.

-good architecture 
 -Class names 
Clean code: is subjective and every developer has a personal take on it. There are some ideas that are considered best practice and what constitutes as clean code within the industry and community, but there is no definitive distinction. And I don’t think there ever will be.
Clean architecture: is t build only what is necessary and optimize for maintainability.

it would be wise to make a small user interface for easy temperature data of the cities. it is interface
